## Creating the project
When I saw the specifications for this project, I knew that this project was going to be challenging due to my lack of experience in MongoDB.   
Thankfully, I had a good example from class, which was helpful in completing this project.  

**First Mistake**: *Starting the project too late. Not giving myself enough time to complete the project*  
Since I had the example from class, I thought that this project was not going to take me that long to finish.   
I made the mistake of starting the project on Friday night, and when I went to class on Saturday, I only had 10 commits.  
Despite the fact that I worked on the project for about 7 hours on Saturday, and had a tutoring session, I was unable to complete the project.
